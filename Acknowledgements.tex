\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I want to thank Jess for letting me do my thesis in his lab. I would also like to thank you for your invaluable support you gave me regarding my future academic career. I consider myself grateful to have been part of your group. Your ability to feel people is inspiring. You understand what it takes to build a group with leadership, confidence and trust. And this I respect and look up to. 

Also I want to express my deepest gratitude to both my supervisors Dr. Ulrich Blache and Fabian Passini. Even though we rarely worked together, you were always encouraging and positive, tirelessly giving me constructive advice when I needed it. Your ability to focus while filtering out the noise is incomparable and inspiring. I found a mentor in both of you and I could not have wished for two better supervisors. 


Also I would like to thank the whole group to make my Thesis a very warm, welcoming and overall pleasant experience. 


And last, I want to thank Mavi. I cannot put into words how much you helped. I will always be grateful for your patience and love.
