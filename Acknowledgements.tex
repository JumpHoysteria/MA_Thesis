\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I want to thank Jess to welcome me in his lab. The group  It was inspiring to work in this lab, full of good spirit and good people. And it is largely due to him, as he is the one that does stuff. 

Also I want to express my deepest gratitude to both my supervisors Dr. Ulrich Blache and Fabian Passini. I could not have wished for two better supervisors. Uli quickly became my mentor and I was able to learn a lot during this time. At the end of every discussion, I was smarter than before. No matter whether it's about discussion of the perks of the academic life or the pitfalls of technical intricacies, he will continue to inspire people with his witted-tongue and sharp mind. I was very blessed to experience the tireless optimism that originates from Fabian. Always encouraging and positive.

Furthermore, I want to thank Patrick Jäger for always being a helping hand for flow chamber related business and the rest. I thank Barbara "Streisand" Niederöst und Maja Bollhalder for their tireless support and patience. 

I thank Matthias CHECKNAME for the time he took to give me a glimpse to CRISPR/Cas9 and the genetic wonderland of Oz. 

And in the end, I want to thank Mavi. I cannot put into words how much I value your presence.
