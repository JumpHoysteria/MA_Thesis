\section{Cell Culture}
By courtesy of Dr. Ulrich Blache, we had access to human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. They are grown in T75 Cell Culture Flasks (\product{Thermo Fisher, CN: 156499}) in an incubator with constant conditions of 37 C and 5 Percent CO2. Growth Medium consist of MEM$\alpha$ with nucleosides (\product{Thermo Fisher, CN: 22571020}), 10\% FBS and 5ng/ml Growth Factor FGF-2 (\myworries{Product Number}).
