\begin{itemize}
    \item Regenerative medicine is a relatively new field of biomedical research, which is driven by the vision to restore the physiological status in a patient, by means of supporting endogenic restorative capabilities and/or implantation of biogenic substitutes often with cellular components that help to ameliorate the condition.The average person is always getting older and age-associated disease will become more prevalent. This increases pressure for medical therapies that address them. The world wide market for regenerative market is said to grow 20\% each year, and is projected to reach around USD 73 billion by the year 2027.[MarketsAndMarkets, https://cutt.ly/WrUSspf] The growing tendency can be explained because of the paradigm of regenerative therapy, which is restoration and reconstitution of patient. Some examples are cardiac repair [Pittenger2004] and applications in spine-surgery [Goldschlager2010]. However, there is one that deserves special mention: Mesenchymal Stem cell applications to tendon healing. Even though the goal is clear, there are still many open questions, that hinder systematic success. Since XXXX, there are studies being done were cells are co-transplanted to ameliorate healing and thought to eventually lead to a better patient outcome. This strategy is derived from the school of thought, that cells can direct other cells behaviour. Either by direct interaction (e.g. by secretion of cytokines or para-hormones) or through secondary pathways like orchestrating ECM-composition that in turn helps in the coordination of cellular behaviour and implant biointegration. Stem cells are often the preferred choice, since they have the property of self-renewal and a lot of differentiation potential. 
\myworries{Immunomodulatory and relative abundance?} This versatile qualities render them pivotal to therapies emerging from regenerative medicine. Still a lot of open questions of the inner workings from MSC's. One of the questions is what channels are involved in physical force sensing in MSCs and how they react to it.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Piezo1}

\myworries{ADD NICE PIEZO1-Picture!}

Piezo1 or Fam38A, is a protein, which in consolidation with two other Piezo1 constitutes the homo-trimeric mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. This channel has an opening mechanism directly related to force exposition above a certain threshold level. When in an open state, it selectively permits passage of cations, albeit non-specifically with a slight preference for Ca2+-ions. [Coste2010]. The channel is expressed almost ubiquitously in our body. [Coste2010] Also Piezo1 is evolutionary preserved with analogues spanning multiple evolutionary kingdoms including plants. [Coste2010][Coste2012]\\
Although, in literature the name Piezo1 is used interchangeably for the channel itself as also the protein that produces the channel, in this work we will from now one refer to the channel as Piezo1.

\subsection{Yoda1}
Yoda1 is a small molecule, able to chemically activate Piezo1 selectively. [Syeda2015] The proposed mechanism is that Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, lowering the mechanical threshold for activation. [Botello-Smith2019] This allows Yoda1 to partially activate Piezo1 in absence of externally applied forces. [Lacroix2018]

\subsection{Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells}
While there are differing anatomical sources where mesenchymal stem cells can be isolated from, including the umbilical cord and adipose tissue [Barlow2008], [Hass 2011] in this work we are going to focus on human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSC) and from now on will refer to those cells as mesenchymal stem cells (or: MSC). \hfill \newline 
MSC's are characterized by three different properties: First, they hold the potential to differentiate into a number of daughter cells, like osteocyte (bone), chondrocyte (cartilage), adipocyte (fat-tissue) and tenocyte (tendon). [Ng2008] Second, they expose a set of stem cell markers like CD31, CD34 and cKit. While those markers are associated with stem cells, they are not unique to stem cells. [Battula2009] And thirdly, they can be isolated from primary tissue based on their capacity to stick on plastic. [BÃ¼hring2007] Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that attributes an immunomodulatory effect of MSC on injured or inflamed sites, which could relate to better outcome in medical intervention.
