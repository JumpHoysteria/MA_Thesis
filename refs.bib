	abstract = {Mechanical stimuli drive many physiological processes, including touch and pain sensation, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. Mechanically activated (MA) cation channel activities have been recorded in many cells, but the responsible molecules have not been identified. We characterized a rapidly adapting MA current in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Expression profiling and RNA interference knockdown of candidate genes identified Piezo1 (Fam38A) to be required for MA currents in these cells. Piezo1 and related Piezo2 (Fam38B) are vertebrate multipass transmembrane proteins with homologs in invertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Overexpression of mouse Piezo1 or Piezo2 induced two kinetically distinct MA currents. Piezos are expressed in several tissues, and knockdown of Piezo2 in dorsal root ganglia neurons specifically reduced rapidly adapting MA currents. We propose that Piezos are components of MA cation channels.},

 abstract = {Mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels transduce various forms of mechanical forces into cellular signals that play vital roles in many important biological processes in vertebrate organisms. Besides mechanical forces, Piezo1 is selectively activated by micromolar concentrations of the small molecule Yoda1 through an unknown mechanism. Here, using a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we identify an allosteric Yoda1 binding pocket located in the putative mechanosensory domain, approximately 40â€‰{\aA} away from the central pore. Our simulations further indicate that the presence of the agonist correlates with increased tension-induced motions of the Yoda1-bound subunit. Our results suggest a model wherein Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, facilitating force-induced conformational changes, effectively lowering the channel's mechanical threshold for activation. The identification of an allosteric agonist binding site in Piezo1 channels will pave the way for the rational design of future Piezo modulators with clinical value.},
