	abstract = {Mechanical stimuli drive many physiological processes, including touch and pain sensation, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. Mechanically activated (MA) cation channel activities have been recorded in many cells, but the responsible molecules have not been identified. We characterized a rapidly adapting MA current in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Expression profiling and RNA interference knockdown of candidate genes identified Piezo1 (Fam38A) to be required for MA currents in these cells. Piezo1 and related Piezo2 (Fam38B) are vertebrate multipass transmembrane proteins with homologs in invertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Overexpression of mouse Piezo1 or Piezo2 induced two kinetically distinct MA currents. Piezos are expressed in several tissues, and knockdown of Piezo2 in dorsal root ganglia neurons specifically reduced rapidly adapting MA currents. We propose that Piezos are components of MA cation channels.},

abstract = {Cellular mechanotransduction, the process of translating mechanical forces into biological signals, is crucial for a wide range of physiological processes. A role for ion channels in sensing mechanical forces has been proposed for decades, but their identity in mammals remained largely elusive until the discovery of Piezos. Recent research on Piezos has underscored their importance in somatosensation (touch perception, proprioception and pulmonary respiration), red blood cell volume regulation, vascular physiology and various human genetic disorders.},

@article{Zeng2018,
abstract = {Activation of stretch-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and blood pressure. Although this homeostatic baroreflex has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both Piezo1 and Piezo2 in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced baroreflex and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack Piezos had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with baroreflex failure. Optogenetic activation of Piezo2-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate baroreflex in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute blood pressure control.},

@article{Gudipaty2017,
abstract = {Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.},

@article{Botello2019,
abstract = {Mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels transduce various forms of mechanical forces into cellular signals that play vital roles in many important biological processes in vertebrate organisms. Besides mechanical forces, Piezo1 is selectively activated by micromolar concentrations of the small molecule Yoda1 through an unknown mechanism. Here, using a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we identify an allosteric Yoda1 binding pocket located in the putative mechanosensory domain, approximately 40 {\AA} away from the central pore. Our simulations further indicate that the presence of the agonist correlates with increased tension-induced motions of the Yoda1-bound subunit. Our results suggest a model wherein Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, facilitating force-induced conformational changes, effectively lowering the channel's mechanical threshold for activation. The identification of an allosteric agonist binding site in Piezo1 channels will pave the way for the rational design of future Piezo modulators with clinical value.},
