abstract = {Cells perceive their microenvironment not only through soluble signals but also through physical and mechanical cues, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or confined adhesiveness. By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour. These findings identify YAP/TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical cues instructed by the cellular microenvironment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from primary tissue is hampered by the limited selectivity of available markers. So far, CD271 is one of the most specific markers for bone marrow (BM)-derived MSC. In search of additional markers, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with specificity for immature cells were screened by flow cytometry for their specific reactivity with the rare CD271+ population. The recognized CD271+ populations were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the clonogenic capacity of the sorted cells was analyzed for their ability to give rise to CFU-F. The results showed that only the CD271bright but not the CD271dim population contained CFUF. Two-color flow cytometry analysis revealed that only the CD271bright population was positive for the established MSC markers CD10, CD13, CD73, and CD105. In addition, a variety of mAbs specific for novel and partially unknown antigens selectively recognized the CD271bright population but no other BM cells. The new MSC-specific molecules included the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-$\beta$ (CD140b), HER-2/erbB2 (CD340), frizzled-9 (CD349), the recently described W8B2 antigen, as well as cell-surface antigens defined by the antibodies W1C3, W3D5, W4A5, W5C4, W5C5, W7C6, 9A3, 58B1, F9-3C2F1, and HEK-3D6. In conclusion, the described markers are suitable for the prospective isolation of highly purified BM-MSC. These MSC may be used as an improved starting population for transplantation in diseases like osteogenesis imperfecta, cartilage repair, and myocardial infarction. {\textcopyright} 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Using global gene-expression profiling arrays to detect RNA transcripts, we have identified markers that are specific for MSCs and their differentiated progeny. Further, we have also identified pathways that MSCs use to differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages. We identified activin-mediated transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$ signaling, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling as the key pathways involved in MSC differentiation. The differentiation of MSCs into these lineages is affected when these pathways are perturbed by inhibitors of cell surface receptor function. Since growth and differentiation are tightly linked processes, we also examined the importance of these 3 pathways in MSC growth. These 3 pathways were necessary and sufficient for MSC growth. Inhibiting any of these pathways slowed MSC growth, whereas a combination of TGF-$\beta$, PDGF, and $\beta$-FGF was sufficient to grow MSCs in a serum-free medium up to 5 passages. Thus, this study illustrates it is possible to predict signaling pathways active in cellular differentiation and growth using microarray data and experimentally verify these predictions. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {The simplest cell-like structure, the lipid bilayer vesicle, can respond to mechanical deformation by elastic membrane dilation/thinning and curvature changes. When a protein is inserted in the lipid bilayer, an energetic cost may arise because of hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and bilayer. Localized changes in bilayer thickness and curvature may compensate for this mismatch. The peptides alamethicin and gramicidin and the bacterial membrane protein MscL form mechanically gated (MG) channels when inserted in lipid bilayers. Their mechanosensitivity may arise because channel opening is associated with a change in the protein's membrane-occupied area, its hydrophobic mismatch with the bilayer, excluded water volume, or a combination of these effects. As a consequence, bilayer dilation/thinning or changes in local membrane curvature may shift the equilibrium between channel conformations. Recent evidence indicates that MG channels in specific animal cell types (e.g., Xenopus oocytes) are also gated directly by bilayer tension. However, animal cells lack the rigid cell wall that protects bacteria and plants cells from excessive expansion of their bilayer. Instead, a cortical cytoskeleton (CSK) provides a structural framework that allows the animal cell to maintain a stable excess membrane area (i.e., for its volume occupied by a sphere) in the form of membrane folds, ruffles, and microvilli. This excess membrane provides an immediate membrane reserve that may protect the bilayer from sudden changes in bilayer tension. Contractile elements within the CSK may locally slacken or tighten bilayer tension to regulate mechanosensitivity, whereas membrane blebbing and tight seal patch formation, by using up membrane reserves, may increase membrane mechanosensitivity. In specific cases, extracellular and/or CSK proteins (i.e., tethers) may transmit mechanical forces to the process (e.g., hair cell MG channels, MS intracellular Ca2+ release, and transmitter release) without increasing tension in the lipid bilayer.},

abstract = {Background: Conventionally, mesenchymal stem cells are functionally isolated from primary tissue based on their capacity to adhere to a plastic surface. This isolation procedure is hampered by the unpredictable influence of co-cultured hematopoietic and/or other unrelated cells and/or by the elimination of a late adhering mesenchymal stem cells subset during removal of undesired cells. To circumvent these limitations, several antibodies have been developed to facilitate the prospective isolation of mesenchymal stem cells. Recently, we described a panel of monoclonal antibodies with superior selectivity for mesenchymal stem cells, including the monoclonal antibodies W8B2 against human mesenchymal stem cell antigen-1 (MSCA-1) and 39D5 against a CD56 epitope, which is not expressed on natural killer cells. Design and Methods: Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells from healthy donors were analyzed and isolated by flow cytometry using a large panel of antibodies against surface antigens including CD271, MSCA-1, and CD56. The growth of mesenchymal stem cells was monitored by colony formation unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays. The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into defined lineages was induced by culture in appropriate media and verified by immunostaining. Results: Multicolor cell sorting and CFU-F assays showed that mesenchymal stem cells were {\~{}}90-fold enriched in the MSCA-1 +CD56- fraction and ∼180-fold in the MSCA-1 +CD56 + fraction. Phenotype analysis revealed that the expression of CD10, CD26, CD106, and CD146 was restricted to the MSCA-1 +CD56 - mesenchymal stem cells subset and CD166 to MSCA-1 +CD56 ± mesenchymal stem cells. Further differentiation of these subsets showed that chondrocytes and pancreatic-like islets were predominantly derived from MSCA-1 +CD56 ± cells whereas adipocytes emerged exclusively from MSCA-1 +CD56 - cells. The culture of single sorted MSCA-1 +CD56 + cells resulted in the appearance of phenotypically heterogeneous clones with distinct proliferation and differentiation capacities. Conclusions: Novel mesenchymal stem cells subsets with distinct phenotypic and functional properties were identified. Our data suggest that the MSCA-1 +CD56 + subset is an attractive starting population for autologous chondrocyte transplantation. {\textcopyright}2009 Ferrata Storti Foundation.},

abstract = {The effective regulation of fluid shear stress (FSS) on the lineage specification of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains to be addressed. We hypothesized that when MSCs are recruited to musculoskeletal system following stimulation, their differentiation into osteogenic or chondrogenic cells is directed by the rate of FSS ($\Delta$SS) through modulation of the mechanosensitive, cation-selective channels (MSCCs), intracellular calcium levels, and F-actin. To this end, MSCs were exposed to laminar FSS linearly increased from 0 to 10dyn/cm2 in 0, 2, or 20min and maintained at 10dyn/cm2 for a total of 20min (termed as $\Delta$SS 0-0′, 0-2′, and 0-20′, respectively, representing more physiological (0-0′) and non-physiological (0-2′ and 0-20′) $\Delta$SS treatments). Our results showed 0-0′ facilitated MSC differentiation towards chondrogenic and not osteogenic phenotype, by promoting moderate intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase from the calcium channels with the exception of MSCCs or intracellular calcium stores, and F-actin organization. In contrast, 0-2′ promoted MSCs towards osteogenic and not chondrogenic phenotype, by inducing significant [Ca2+]i increase mainly from the MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. However, 0-20′ elicited the modest osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes, as it induced the lowest [Ca2+]i increase mainly from MSCCs, and F-actin assembly. Our results suggest that compared to the more physiological $\Delta$SS, the non-physiological $\Delta$SS favors [Ca2+]i influx from MSCCs. An appropriate non-physiological $\Delta$SS (0-2′) even elicits a large [Ca2+]i influx from the MSCCs that reverses the lineage specification of MSCs, providing validation for the high mechanosensitivity of MSCs and guidance for training osteoporosis and osteoarthritis patients.},

abstract = {The calpain system originally comprised three molecules: two Ca2+-dependent proteases, $\mu$-calpain and m-calpain, and a third polypeptide, calpastatin, whose only known function is to inhibit the two calpains. Both $\mu$- and m-calpain are heterodimers containing an identical 28-kDa subunit and an 80-kDa subunit that shares 55-65{\%} sequence homology between the two proteases. The crystallographic structure of m-calpain reveals six "domains" in the 80-kDa subunit: 1) a 19-amino acid NH2-terminal sequence; 2) and 3) two domains that constitute the active site, IIa and IIb; 4) domain III; 5) an 18-amino acid extended sequence linking domain III to domain IV; and 6) domain IV, which resembles the penta EF-hand family of polypeptides. The single calpastatin gene can produce eight or more calpastatin polypeptides ranging from 17 to 85 kDa by use of different promoters and alternative splicing events. The physiological significance of these different calpastatins is unclear, although all bind to three different places on the calpain molecule; binding to at least two of the sites is Ca2+ dependent. Since 1989, cDNA cloning has identified 12 additional mRNAs in mammals that encode polypeptides homologous to domains IIa and IIb of the 80-kDa subunit of $\mu$- and m-calpain, and calpain-like mRNAs have been identified in other organisms. The molecules encoded by these mRNAs have not been isolated, so little is known about their properties. How calpain activity is regulated in cells is still unclear, but the calpains ostensibly participate in a variety of cellular processes including remodeling of cytoskeletal/membrane attachments, different signal transduction pathways, and apoptosis. Deregulated calpain activity following loss of Ca2+ homeostasis results in tissue damage in response to events such as myocardial infarcts, stroke, and brain trauma.},

The understanding of equine stem cell biology, biofactors, and scaffolds, and their potential therapeutic use in horses are rudimentary at present. Mesenchymal stem cell isolation has been proclaimed from several equine tissues in the past few years. Based on the criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy, most of these cells are more correctly referred to as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, unless there is proof that they exhibit the fundamental in vivo characteristics of pluripotency and the ability to self-renew. That said, these cells from various tissues hold great promise for therapeutic use in horses. The 3 components of tissue engineering-cells, biological factors, and biomaterials-are increasingly being applied in equine medicine, fuelled by better scaffolds and increased understanding of individual biofactors and cell sources. The effectiveness of stem cell-based therapies and most tissue engineering concepts has not been demonstrated sufficiently in controlled clinical trials in equine patients to be regarded as evidence-based medicine. In the meantime, the medical mantra "do no harm" should prevail, and the application of stem cell-based therapies in the horse should be done critically and cautiously, and treatment outcomes (good and bad) should be recorded and reported. Stem cell and tissue engineering research in the horse has exciting comparative and equine specific perspectives that most likely will benefit the health of horses and humans.

Calpains are ubiquitously expressed proteases regulating several processes including cellular adhesion and motility as well as inflammation and angiogenesis. Calpains can be targeted by inhibitors, and their inhibition was shown to reduce organ damage in various disease models. We aimed to assess the role of calpains in skin healing and the potential benefit of calpain inhibition on scar formation. We used a pertinent model where calpain activity is inhibited only in lesional organs, namely transgenic mice overexpressing calpastatin (CPST), a specific natural calpain inhibitor. CPST mice showed a striking delay in wound healing particularly in the initial steps compared to wild types (WT). CPST wounds displayed reduced proliferation in the epidermis and delayed re-epithelization. Granulation tissue formation was impaired in CPST mice, with a reduction in CD45+ leukocyte infiltrate and in CD31+ blood vessel density. Interestingly, wounds on WT skin grafted on CPST mice (WT/CPST) showed a similar delayed healing with reduced angiogenesis and inflammation compared to wounds on WT/WT mice demonstrating the implication of calpain activity in distant extra-cutaneous cells during wound healing. CPST wounds showed a reduction in alpha-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$SMA) expressing myofibroblasts as well as $\alpha$SMA RNA expression suggesting a defect in granulation tissue contraction. At later stages of skin healing, calpain inhibition proved beneficial by reducing collagen production and wound fibrosis. In vitro, human fibroblasts exposed to calpeptin, a pan-calpain inhibitor, showed reduced collagen synthesis, impaired TGF$\beta$-induced differentiation into $\alpha$SMA-expressing myofibroblasts, and were less efficient in a collagen gel contraction assay. In conclusion, calpains are major players in granulation tissue formation. In view of their specific effects on fibroblasts a late inhibition of calpains should be considered for scar reduction. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nassar et al.},

abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adult tissues are promising candidates for personalized cell therapy and tissue engineering. Significant progress was achieved in our understanding of the regulation of MSCs proliferation and differentiation by different cues during the last years. Proliferation and differentiation of MSCs is sensitive to the extracellular matrix properties, physical signals, and chemical signaling. Sheath stress, matrix stiffness, surface adhesiveness, micro- and nanotopography define cell shape and dictate lineage commitment of MSCs even in the absence of specific chemical signals. We discuss mechanotransduction as the major route from the extracellular matrix through the cytoskeleton towards signaling pathways and gene expression. All components of the cytoskeleton from primary cilium and focal adhesions to actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments are involved in the mechanotransduction. Differentiation of MSCs is regulated via the complex network of inter-related signaling pathways, including RhoA/ROCK, Akt/Erk, and YAP/TAZ effectors of the Hippo pathway. These pathways could be regulated both by chemical and mechanical stimuli. Attenuation of these pathways in MSCs results in specific changes in focal adhesions and actin cytoskeleton. Besides, the differentiation of MSCs affects microtubules and intermediate filaments. Recent findings highlight the role of intranuclear actin in the regulation of transcription factors in response to mechanical environmental stimuli. Alterations of cytoskeletal components reflect the MSC senescence state and their migratory capacity. In this review, we discuss the relationships between the molecular interactions in signaling pathways and the morphological response of cytoskeletal components and reveal the complex interrelations between cytoskeleton systems and signaling pathways during lineage commitment of MSCs.},

abstract = {Activation of the thiol protease calpain results in proteolysis of focal adhesion-associated proteins and severing of cytoskeletal-integrin links. We employed a commonly used inhibitor of calpain, calpeptin, to examine a role for this protease in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton under a variety of conditions. Calpeptin induced stress fiber formation in both forskolin- treated REF-52 fibroblasts and serum-starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Surprisingly, calpeptin was the only calpain inhibitor of several tested with the ability to induce these effects, suggesting that calpeptin may act on targets besides calpain. Here we show that calpeptin inhibits tyrosine phosphatases, enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation particularly of paxillin. Calpeptin preferentially inhibits membrane-associated phosphatase activity. Consistent with this observation, in vitro phosphatase assays using purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins demonstrated a preference for the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase-$\alpha$ over the cytosolic protein- tyrosine phosphatase-1B. Furthermore, unlike wide spectrum inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases such as pervanadate, calpeptin appeared to inhibit a subset of phosphatases. Calpeptin-induced assembly of stress fibers was inhibited by botulinum toxin C3, indicating that calpeptin is acting on a phosphatase upstream of the small GTPase Rho, a protein that controls stress fiber and focal adhesion assembly. Not only does this work reveal that calpeptin is an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but it suggests that calpeptin will be a valuable tool to identify the phosphatase activity upstream of Rho.},

In this context, current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for MSC interactions with the immune system and the molecular responses of MSCs to inflammatory signals are discussed. The immunosuppressive activities of MSCs are initiated by cell-to-cell contact and the release of immuno-regulatory molecules. By doing so, MSCs can inhibit the proliferation and function of T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, and can also increase the proliferation of regulatory T cells. However, various problems, such as low transplanted cell viability, poor homing and engraftment into injured tissues, MSC heterogeneity, and lack of adequate information on optimum MSC doses impede clinical applications. On the other hand, it has been shown that the immunomodulatory activities and viabilities of MSCs might be enhanced by 3D-cultured systems, genetic modifications, preconditioning, and targeted-delivery.},

abstract = {The assembly of the Smad complex is critical for TGF$\beta$ signaling, yet the mechanisms that inactivate or empower nuclear Smad complexes are less understood. By means of siRNA screen we identified FAM (USP9x), a deubiquitinase acting as essential and evolutionarily conserved component in TGF$\beta$ and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Smad4 is monoubiquitinated in lysine 519 in vivo, a modification that inhibits Smad4 by impeding association with phospho-Smad2. FAM reverts this negative modification, re-empowering Smad4 function. FAM opposes the activity of Ectodermin/Tif1$\gamma$ (Ecto), a nuclear factor for which we now clarify a prominent role as Smad4 monoubiquitin ligase. Our study points to Smad4 monoubiquitination and deubiquitination as a way for cells to set their TGF$\beta$ responsiveness: loss of FAM disables Smad4-dependent responses in several model systems, with Ecto being epistatic to FAM. This defines a regulative ubiquitination step controlling Smads that is parallel to those impinging on R-Smad phosphorylation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Advancement of these therapies will rely on an ability to identify, isolate, manipulate, and deliver stem cells in a safe and effective manner. Although it is clear that physical signals affect tissue morphogenesis, stem cell differentiation, and healing processes, integration of mechanically induced signaling events remain obscure. Mechanisms underlying sensation and interpretation of mechanical signals by stem cells are the focus of intense study. External mechanical signals have the ability to activate osteogenic signaling pathways in MSCs including Wnt, Ror2, and Runx2.

abstract = {Microenvironments that modulate fate commitments of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are composed of chemical and physical cues, but the latter ones are much less investigated. Here we demonstrate that intermittent fluid shear stress (IFSS), a potent and physiologically relevant mechanical stimulus, regulates osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7)-Osterix axis. Immunostaining showed the localization of TRPM7 near or at cell membrane upon IFSS, and calcium imaging analysis demonstrated the transient increase of cytosolic free calcium. Expressions of osteogenic marker genes including Osterix, but not Runx2, were upregulated after three-hour IFSS. Phosphorylation of p38 and Smad1/5 was promoted by IFSS as well. TRPM7 gene knockdown abolished the promotion of bone-related gene expressions and phosphorylation. We illustrate that TRPM7 is mechanosensitive to shear force of 1.2 Pa, which is much lower than 98 Pa pressure loading reported recently, and mediates distinct mechanotransduction pathways. Additionally, our results suggest the differential roles of TRPM7 in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Together, this study elucidates the mechanotransduction in MSCs fate commitments and displays an efficient mechano-modulation for MSCs osteogenic differentiation. Such findings should be taken into consideration when designing relevant scaffolds and microfluidic devices for osteogenic induction in the future.},

abstract = {Microarchitectural cues drive aligned fibrillar collagen deposition in vivo and in biomaterial scaffolds, but the cell-signaling events that underlie this process are not well understood. Utilizing a multicellular patterning model system that allows for observation of intracellular signaling events during collagen matrix assembly, we investigated the role of calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during this process. We observed spontaneous Ca 2+ oscillations in MSCs during fibrillar collagen assembly, and hypothesized that the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel, a mechanosensitive Ca 2+ -permeable channel, may regulate this signaling. Inhibition of TRPV4 nearly abolished Ca 2+ signaling at initial stages of collagen matrix assembly, while at later times had reduced but significant effects. Importantly, blocking TRPV4 activity dramatically reduced aligned collagen fibril assembly; conversely, activating TRPV4 accelerated aligned collagen formation. TRPV4-dependent Ca 2+ oscillations were found to be independent of pattern shape or subpattern cell location, suggesting this signaling mechanism is necessary for aligned collagen formation but not sufficient in the absence of physical (microarchitectural) cues that force multicellular alignment. As cell-generated mechanical forces are known to be critical to the matrix assembly process, we examined the role of TRPV4-mediated Ca 2+ signaling in force generated across the load-bearing focal adhesion protein vinculin within MSCs using an FRET-based tension sensor. Inhibiting TRPV4 decreased tensile force across vinculin, whereas TRPV4 activation caused a dynamic unloading and reloading of vinculin. Together, these findings suggest TRPV4 activity regulates forces at cell-matrix adhesions and is critical to aligned collagen matrix assembly by MSCs.},

However, the mechanism linking matrix remodeling in 3D to osteogenesis of MSCs remains unclear. Here, we find that MSCs in viscoelastic hydrogels exhibit volume expansion during cell spreading, and greater volume expansion is associated with enhanced osteogenesis. Restriction of expansion by either hydrogels with slow stress relaxation or increased osmotic pressure diminishes osteogenesis, independent of cell morphology. Conversely, induced expansion by hypoosmotic pressure accelerates osteogenesis. Volume expansion is mediated by activation of TRPV4 ion channels, and reciprocal feedback between TRPV4 activation and volume expansion controls nuclear localization of RUNX2, but not YAP, to promote osteogenesis. This work demonstrates the role of cell volume in regulating cell fate in 3D culture, and identifies TRPV4 as a molecular sensor of matrix viscoelasticity that regulates osteogenic differentiation.},

However, the molecular mechanism by which mechanical stimuli are converted into osteogenesis and bone formation remains unclear. Here we report that Piezo1, a bona fide mechanotransducer that is critical for various biological processes, plays a critical role in bone formation. Knockout of Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells disrupts the osteogenesis of osteoblasts and severely impairs bone structure and strength. Bone loss that is induced by mechanical unloading is blunted in knockout mice. Intriguingly, simulated microgravity treatment reduced the function of osteoblasts by suppressing the expression of Piezo1. Furthermore, osteoporosis patients show reduced expression of Piezo1, which is closely correlated with osteoblast dysfunction. These data collectively suggest that Piezo1 functions as a key mechanotransducer for conferring mechanosensitivity to osteoblasts and determining mechanicalload- dependent bone formation, and represents a novel therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis or mechanical unloading-induced severe bone loss.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: The mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel has important roles in vascular physiology and disease. Yoda1 is a small-molecule agonist, but the pharmacology of these channels is otherwise limited. Experimental Approach: Yoda1 analogues were generated by synthetic chemistry. Intracellular Ca 2+ and Tl + measurements were made in HEK 293 or CHO cell lines overexpressing channel subunits and in HUVECs, which natively express Piezo1. Isometric tension recordings were made from rings of mouse thoracic aorta. Key Results: Modification of the pyrazine ring of Yoda1 yielded an analogue, which lacked agonist activity but reversibly antagonized Yoda1. The analogue is referred to as Dooku1. Dooku1 inhibited 2 $\mu$M Yoda1-induced Ca 2+ -entry with IC 50 s of 1.3 $\mu$M (HEK 293 cells) and 1.5 $\mu$M (HUVECs) yet failed to inhibit constitutive Piezo1 channel activity. It had no effect on endogenous ATP-evoked Ca 2+ elevation or store-operated Ca 2+ entry in HEK 293 cells or Ca 2+ entry through TRPV4 or TRPC4 channels overexpressed in CHO and HEK 293 cells. Yoda1 caused dose-dependent relaxation of aortic rings, which was mediated by an endothelium- and NO-dependent mechanism and which was antagonized by Dooku1 and analogues of Dooku1. Conclusion and Implications: Chemical antagonism of Yoda1-evoked Piezo1 channel activity is possible, and the existence of a specific chemical interaction site is suggested with distinct binding and efficacy domains.},

MSCs differentiate readily into chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteocytes, and they can support hematopoietic stem cells or embryonic stem cells in culture. Evidence suggests MSCs can also express phenotypic characteristics of endothelial, neural, smooth muscle, skeletal myoblasts, and cardiac myocyte cells. When introduced into the infarcted heart, MSCs prevent deleterious remodeling and improve recovery, although further understanding of MSC differentiation in the cardiac scar tissue is still needed. MSCs have been injected directly into the infarct, or they have been administered intravenously and seen to home to the site of injury. Examination of the interaction of allogeneic MSCs with cells of the immune system indicates little rejection by T cells. Persistence of allogeneic MSCs in vivo suggests their potential "off the shelf" therapeutic use for multiple recipients. Clinical use of cultured human MSCs (hMSCs) has begun for cancer patients, and recipients have received autologous or allogeneic MSCs. Research continues to support the desirable traits of MSCs for development of cellular therapeutics for many tissues, including the cardiovascular system. In summary, hMSCs isolated from adult bone marrow provide an excellent model for development of stem cell therapeutics, and their potential use in the cardiovascular system is currently under investigation in the laboratory and clinical settings.},

abstract = {Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapies in diverse conditions including tissue engineering. Advancement of these therapies relies on the ability to direct MSCs toward specific cell phenotypes. Despite identification of applied forces that affect self-maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation of MSCs, mechanisms underlying the integration of mechanically induced signaling cascades and interpretation of mechanical signals by MSCs remain elusive. During the past decade, many researchers have demonstrated that external applied forces can activate osteogenic signaling pathways in MSCs, including Wnt, Ror2, and Runx2. Besides, recent advances have highlighted the critical role of internal forces due to cell-matrix interaction in MSC function. These internal forces can be achieved by the materials that cells reside in through its mechanical properties, such as rigidity, topography, degradability, and substrate patterning. MSCs can generate contractile forces to sense these mechanical properties and thereby perceive mechanical information that directs broad aspects of MSC functions, including lineage commitment. Although many signaling pathways have been elucidated in material-induced lineage specification of MSCs, discovering the mechanisms by which MSCs respond to such cell-generated forces is still challenging because of the highly intricate signaling milieu present in MSC environment. However, bioengineers are bridging this gap by developing platforms to control mechanical cues with improved throughput and precision, thereby enabling further investigation of mechanically induced MSC functions. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances that how applied forces and cell-generated forces may be engineered to determine MSC fate, and overview a subset of the operative signal transduction mechanisms and experimental platforms that have emerged in MSC mechanobiology research. Our main goal is to provide an up-to-date view of MSC mechanobiology that is relevant to both mechanical loading and mechanical properties of the environment, and introduce these emerging platforms for tissue engineering use.},

This study comprehensively compared human placenta-derived MSC (hpMSC) and human bone marrow-derived MSC (hbmMSC) in terms of cell characteristics, optimal growth conditions and in vivo safety specifically to determine if hpMSC could represent a source of human MSC for clinical trial. MSC were isolated from human placenta (hpMSC) and human bone marrow (hbmMSC) and expanded ex vivo using good manufacturing practice-compliant reagents. hpMSC and hbmMSC showed similar proliferation characteristics in different basal culture media types, fetal calf serum (FCS) concentrations, FCS heat-inactivation experiments, flask types and media replacement responsiveness. However, hpMSC and hbmMSC differed with respect to their proliferation capabilities at different seeding densities, with hbmMSC proliferating more slowly than hpMSC in every experiment. hpMSC had greater long-term growth ability than hbmMSC. MSC from both sources exhibited similar light microscopy morphology, size, cell surface phenotype, and mesodermal differentiation ability with the exception that hpMSC consistently appeared less able to differentiate to the adipogenic lineage. A comparison of both hbmMSC and hpMSC from early and medium passage cultures using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) GeneChip analysis confirmed GTG-banding data that no copy number changes had been acquired during sequential passaging. In three of three informative cases (in which the gender of the delivered baby was male), hpMSC were of maternal origin. Neither hpMSC nor hbmMSC caused any acute toxicity in normal mice when injected intravenously at the same, or higher, doses than those currently used in clinical trials of hbmMSC.

abstract = {The present study addressed adult human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation toward the osteoblastic lineage in response to alternating electric current, a biophysical stimulus. For this purpose, MSCs (chosen because of their proven capability for osteodifferentiation in the presence of select bone morphogenetic proteins) were dispersed and cultured within electric-conducting type I collagen hydrogels, in the absence of supplemented exogenous dexamethasone and/or growth factors, and were exposed to either 10 or 40 $\mu$A alternating electric current for 6 h per day. Under these conditions, MSCs expressed both early- (such as Runx-2 and osterix) and late- (specifically, osteopontin and osteocalcin) osteogenic genes as a function of level, and duration of exposure to alternating electric current. Compared to results obtained after 7 days, gene expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin (late-osteogenic genes) increased at day 14. In contrast, expression of these osteogenic markers from MSCs cultured under similar conditions and time periods, but not exposed to alternating electric current, did not increase as a function of time. Most importantly, expression of genes pertinent to the either adipogenic (specifically, Fatty Acid Binding Protein-4) or chondrogenic (specifically, type II collagen) pathways was not detected when MSCs were exposed to the aforementioned alternating electric-current conditions tested in the present study. The present research study was the first to provide evidence that alternating electric current promoted the differentiation of adult human MSCs toward the osteogenic pathway.

abstract = {The first sequencing of a complete genome was published forty years ago by the double Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Frederick Sanger. That corresponded to the small sized genome of a bacteriophage, but since then there have been many complex organisms whose DNA have been sequenced. This was possible thanks to continuous advances in the fields of biochemistry and molecular genetics, but also in other areas such as nanotechnology and computing. Nowadays, sequencing sensors based on genetic material have little to do with those used by Sanger. The emergence of mass sequencing sensors, or new generation sequencing (NGS) meant a quantitative leap both in the volume of genetic material that was able to be sequenced in each trial, as well as in the time per run and its cost. One can envisage that incoming technologies, already known as fourth generation sequencing, will continue to cheapen the trials by increasing DNA reading lengths in each run. All of this would be impossible without sensors and detection systems becoming smaller and more precise. This article provides a comprehensive overview on sensors for DNA sequencing developed within the last 40 years.},

Stem cells have the unique ability to differentiate into a variety of musculoskeletal tissues including bone or cartilage. Moreover they have been shown to secrete growth factors that promote matrix repair and regeneration and can down regulate inflammation and immune cell functions. It is these combined activities that make stem cells attractive candidates for advancing current techniques in spine surgery and possibly mitigating those pathologies responsible for tissue degeneration and failure thereby minimising the need for surgical intervention at a later date. This review focuses on the characteristics of progenitor cells from different sources and explores their potential as adjuncts for both current and future applications in spine surgery. Where possible we draw on the experimental outcomes from our own preclinical studies using adult mesenchymal progenitor stem cells, as well as related studies by others to support our contention that stem cell based therapies will play a significant role in spine surgery in the future.},

For each diabetic dog, 5 million human bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells/kg were differentiated to form insulin-producing cells using a trichostatin-based protocol. Cells were then loaded in 2 TheraCyte capsules which were transplanted under the rectus sheath. One dog died 4 d postoperatively from pneumonia. Six dogs were followed up with for 6 to 18 mo. Euglycemia was achieved in 4 dogs. Their glucose tolerance curves exhibited a normal pattern demonstrating that the encapsulated cells were glucose sensitive and insulin responsive. In the remaining 2 dogs, the fasting blood sugar levels were reduced but did not reach normal values. The sera of all transplanted dogs contained human insulin and C-peptide with a negligible amount of canine insulin. Removal of the transplanted capsules was followed by prompt return of diabetes. Intracytoplasmic insulin granules were seen by immunofluorescence in cells from the harvested capsules. Furthermore, all pancreatic endocrine genes were expressed. This study demonstrated that the TheraCyte capsule or a similar device can provide adequate immunoisolation, an important issue when stem cells are considered for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Widespread death of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hampers the development of stem cell therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD). Cell pre-conditioning might help cope with this challenge. We tested whether let-7f-5p-modified MSCs could prolong the survival of MSCs after transplantation. When exposed to A$\beta$25-35 in vitro, MSCs showed significant early apoptosis with decrease in the let-7f-5p levels and increased caspase-3 expression. Upregulating microRNA let-7f-5p in MSCs alleviated A$\beta$25-35-induced apoptosis by decreasing the caspase-3 levels. After computerized analysis and the luciferase reporter assay, we identified that caspases-3 was the target gene of let-7f-5p. In vivo, hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed the success of MSCs transplantation into the lateral ventricles, and the let-7f-5p upregulation group showed the lowest apoptotic rate of MSCs detected by TUNEL immunohistochemistry analysis and immunofluorescence. Similarly, bioluminescent imaging showed that let-7f-5p upregulation moderately prolonged the retention of MSCs in brain. In summary, we identified the anti-apoptotic role of let-7f-5p in A$\beta$25-35-induced cytotoxicity, as well as the protective effect of let-7f-5p on survival of grafted MSCs by targeting caspase-3 in AD models. These findings show a promising approach of microRNA-modified MSCs transplantation as a therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.},

Some essential problems remain to be solved before the clinical application of MSC. Platelet lysate (PL) has recently been used as a substitute for FBS in MSC amplification in vitro to achieve clinically applicable numbers of MSC. In addition to promising trials in regenerative medicine, such as in the treatment of major bone defects and myocardial infarction, MSC have shown therapeutic effect other than direct hematopoiesis support in hematopoietic reconstruction. It has been confirmed that MSC promote hematopoietic cell engraftment and immune recovery after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, probably through the provision of cytokines, matrix proteins, and cell-to-cell contacts. Their suppressive effects on immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells and DC cells, suggest MSCs as a novel therapy for GVHD and other autoimmune disorders. These cells thus present as promising candidates for cellular therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and autoimmune disorders. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Japanese Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Current evidence suggests a central role for autophagy in Alzheimer disease (AD), and dysfunction in the autophagic system may lead to amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) accumulation. Using in vitro and in vivo AD models, the present study investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSC s) could enhance autophagy and thus exert a neuroprotective effect through modulation of A$\beta$ clearance In A$\beta$-treated neuronal cells, MSC s increased cellular viability and enhanced LC3-II expression compared with cells treated with A$\beta$ only. Immunofluorescence revealed that MSC coculture in A$\beta$-treated neuronal cells increased the number of LC3-II -positive autophagosomes that were colocalized with a lysosomal marker. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that most autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in A$\beta$-treated cells were not fused with lysosomes, whereas a large portion of autophagosomes were conjoined with lysosomes in MSC s cocultured with A$\beta$-treated neuronal cells. Furthermore, MSC coculture markedly increased A$\beta$ immunoreactivity colocalized within lysosomes and decreased intracellular A$\beta$ levels compared with A$\beta$-treated cells. In A$\beta$-treated animals, MSC administration significantly increased autophagosome induction, final maturation of late AVs, and fusion with lysosomes. Moreover, MSC administration significantly reduced the level of A$\beta$ in the hippocampus, which was elevated in A$\beta$-treated mice, concomitant with increased survival of hippocampal neurons. Finally, MSC coculture upregulated BEC N1/Beclin 1 expression in AD models. These results suggest that MSC s significantly enhance autolysosome formation and clearance of A$\beta$ in AD models, which may lead to increased neuronal survival against A$\beta$ toxicity. Modulation of the autophagy pathway to repair the damaged AD brain using MSC s would have a significant impact on future strategies for AD treatment.{\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

Here we determine the three-bladed, propeller-like electron cryo-microscopy structure of mouse Piezo1 and functionally reveal its mechanotransduction components. Despite the lack of sequence repetition, we identify nine repetitive units consisting of four transmembrane helices each - which we term transmembrane helical units (THUs) - which assemble into a highly curved blade-like structure. The last transmembrane helix encloses a hydrophobic pore, followed by three intracellular fenestration sites and side portals that contain pore-property-determining residues. The central region forms a 90 {\AA}-long intracellular beam-like structure, which undergoes a lever-like motion to connect THUs to the pore via the interfaces of the C-terminal domain, the anchor-resembling domain and the outer helix. Deleting extracellular loops in the distal THUs or mutating single residues in the beam impairs the mechanical activation of Piezo1. Overall, Piezo1 possesses a unique 38-transmembrane-helix topology and designated mechanotransduction components, which enable a lever-like mechanogating mechanism.},

Naive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are shown here to specify lineage and commit to phenotypes with extreme sensitivity to tissue-level elasticity. Soft matrices that mimic brain are neurogenic, stiffer matrices that mimic muscle are myogenic, and comparatively rigid matrices that mimic collagenous bone prove osteogenic. During the initial week in culture, reprogramming of these lineages is possible with addition of soluble induction factors, but after several weeks in culture, the cells commit to the lineage specified by matrix elasticity, consistent with the elasticity-insensitive commitment of differentiated cell types. Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II blocks all elasticity-directed lineage specification-without strongly perturbing many other aspects of cell function and shape. The results have significant implications for understanding physical effects of the in vivo microenvironment and also for therapeutic uses of stem cells. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, concerns have been raised over the safety of this experimental therapeutic approach, including, for example, whether there is the potential for tumors to develop from transplanted stem cells. Methods and Findings A boy with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) was treated with intracerebellar and intrathecal injection of human fetal neural stem cells. Four years after the first treatment he was diagnosed with a multifocal brain tumor. The biopsied tumor was diagnosed as a glioneuronal neoplasm. We compared the tumor cells and the patient's peripheral blood cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization using X and Y chromosome probes, by PCR for the amelogenin gene X-and Y-specific alleles, by MassArray for the ATM patient specific mutation and for several SNPs, by PCR for polymorphic microsatellites, and by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Molecular and cytogenetic studies showed that the tumor was of nonhost origin suggesting it was derived from the transplanted neural stem cells. Microsatellite and HLA analysis demonstrated that the tumor is derived from at least two donors. Conclusions This is the first report of a human brain tumor complicating neural stem cell therapy. The findings here suggest that neuronal stem/progenitor cells may be involved in gliomagenesis and provide the first example of a donor-derived brain tumor.

Methods In a phase I trial, autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from 25 trial participants with multiple sclerosis and eight matched controls, and culture-expanded to a target single dose of 1-2 × 106 cells/kg. Viability, cell product identity and sterility were assessed prior to infusion. Cytogenetic stability was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of mesenchymal stem cells from 18 multiple sclerosis patients and five controls. Results One patient failed screening. Mesenchymal stem cell culture expansion was successful for 24 of 25 multiple sclerosis patients and six of eight controls. The target dose was achieved in 16-62 days, requiring two to three cell passages. Growth rate and culture success did not correlate with demographic or multiple sclerosis disease characteristics.

abstract = {Background: Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a frequent and debilitating manifestation of diabetes mellitus, to which there are no effective therapeutic approaches. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) have a great potential for the treatment of this syndrome, possibly through regenerative actions on peripheral nerves. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of MSC on spinal neuroinflammation, as well as on ultrastructural aspects of the peripheral nerve in DN-associated sensorial dysfunction. Methods: C57Bl/6 mice were treated with bone marrow-derived MSC (1 × 10 6 ), conditioned medium from MSC cultures (CM-MSC) or vehicle by endovenous route following the onset of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Paw mechanical and thermal nociceptive thresholds were evaluated by using von Frey filaments and Hargreaves test, respectively. Morphological and morphometric analysis of the sciatic nerve was performed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Mediators and markers of neuroinflammation in the spinal cord were measured by radioimmunoassay, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. Results: Diabetic mice presented behavioral signs of sensory neuropathy, mechanical allodynia, and heat hypoalgesia, which were completely reversed by a single administration of MSC or CM-MSC. The ultrastructural analysis of the sciatic nerve showed that diabetic mice exhibited morphological and morphometric alterations, considered hallmarks of DN, such as degenerative changes in axons and myelin sheath, and reduced area and density of unmyelinated fibers. In MSC-treated mice, these structural alterations were markedly less commonly observed and/or less pronounced. Moreover, MSC transplantation inhibited multiple parameters of spinal neuroinflammation found in diabetic mice, causing the reduction of activated astrocytes and microglia, oxidative stress signals, galectin-3, IL-1$\beta$, and TNF-$\alpha$ production. Conversely, MSC increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, and TGF-$\beta$. Conclusions: The present study described the modulatory effects of MSC on spinal cord neuroinflammation in diabetic mice, suggesting new mechanisms by which MSC can improve DN.},

In a conventional migration assay, PDGF-AB, TGF-$\beta$1, and TNF-$\alpha$ showed the most effective chemoattractant activity. When AdMSCs were preincubated with various chemokines or GF, and then allowed to migrate toward medium containing 10{\%} FBS, those preincubated with TNF-$\alpha$ showed the highest migratory activity. Next, hAdMSCs were either preincubated or not with TNF-$\alpha$, and allowed to migrate in response to various GFs or chemokines. Prestimulation with TNF-$\alpha$ increased the migration activity of hAdMSCs compared to unstimulated hAdMSCs. When analyzed by FACS and RT-PCR methods, hAdMSCs were found to express C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1), CCR7, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), CXCR5, CXCR6, EGF receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, TGF-$\beta$ receptor 2, TNF receptor superfamily member 1A, PDGF receptor A and PDGF receptor B at both the protein and the mRNA levels. These results indicate that the migration capacity of hAdMSCs is controlled by various GFs and chemokines. Prior in vitro modulation of the homing capacity of hAdMSCs could stimulate their movement into injured sites in vivo when administered intravenously, thereby improving their therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in the isolation of multipotent progenitor cells, routinely called mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), from various human tissues and organs have provided impetus to the field of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The most widely studied sources of MSCs include bone marrow, adipose, muscle, peripheral blood, umbilical cord, placenta, fetal tissue, and amniotic fluid. According to the standard definition of MSCs, these clonal cells adhere to plastic, express cluster of differentiation (CD) markers such as CD73, CD90, and CD105 markers, and can differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages in vitro. However, isolated MSCs have been reported to vary in their potency and self-renewal potential. As a result, the MSCs used for clinical applications often lead to variable or even conflicting results. The lack of uniform characterization methods both in vitro and in vivo also contributes to this confusion. Therefore, the name “MSCs” itself has been increasingly questioned lately. As the use of MSCs is expanding rapidly, there is an increasing need to understand the potential sources and specific potencies of MSCs. This review discusses and compares the characteristics of MSCs and suggests that the variations in their distinctive features are dependent on the source and method of isolation as well as epigenetic changes during maintenance and growth. We also discuss the potential opportunities and challenges of MSC research with the hope to stimulate their use for therapeutic and regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {In the absence and in the resolution of inflammatory responses, neutrophils rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Here we report about a new apoptosis pathway in these cells that requires calpain-1 activation and is essential for the enzymatic activation of the critical effector caspase-3. Decreased levels of calpastatin, a highly specific intrinsic inhibitor of calpain, resulted in activation of calpain-1, but not calpain-2, in neutrophils undergoing apoptosis, a process that was blocked by a specific calpain-1 inhibitor or by intracellular delivery of a calpastatin peptide. Further support for the importance of the calpastatin-calpain system was obtained by analyzing neutrophils from patients with cystic fibrosis that exhibited delayed apoptosis, associated with markedly increased calpastatin and decreased calpain-1 protein levels compared with neutrophils from control individuals. Additional studies were designed to place calpain-1 into the hierarchy of biochemical events leading to neutrophil apoptosis. Pharmacological calpain inhibition during spontaneous and Fas receptor-induced neutrophil apoptosis prevented cleavage of Bax into an 18-kDa fragment unable to interact with Bcl-XL. Moreover, calpain blocking prevented the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac, which was indispensable for caspase-3 processing and enzymatic activation, both in the presence and absence of agonistic anti-Fas receptor antibodies. Taken together, calpastatin and calpain-1 represent critical proximal elements in a cascade of pro-apoptotic events leading to Bax, mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation, and their altered expression appears to influence the life span of neutrophils under pathologic conditions.},

Studies of sensory neurons have suggested Piezo proteins as subunits of Ca2+ -permeable non-selective cationic channels for detection of noxious mechanical impact. Here we show Piezo1 (Fam38a) channels as sensors of frictional force (shear stress) and determinants of vascular structure in both development and adult physiology. Global or endothelial-specific disruption of mouse Piezo1 profoundly disturbed the developing vasculature and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating. Haploinsufficiency was not lethal but endothelial abnormality was detected in mature vessels. The importance of Piezo1 channels as sensors of blood flow was shown by Piezo1 dependence of shear-stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezo1 to confer sensitivity to shear stress on otherwise resistant cells. Downstream of this calcium influx there was protease activation and spatial reorganization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. The data suggest that Piezo1 channels function as pivotal integrators in vascular biology.},

abstract = {Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that are capable of proliferation, self-maintenance and differentiation towards specific cell phenotypes. These processes are controlled by a variety of cues including physicochemical factors associated with the specific mechanical environment in which the cells reside. The control of stem cell biology through mechanical factors remains poorly understood and is the focus of the developing field of mechanobiology. This review provides an insight into the current knowledge of the role of mechanical forces in the induction of differentiation of stem cells. While the details associated with individual studies are complex and typically associated with the stem cell type studied and model system adopted, certain key themes emerge. First, the differentiation process affects the mechanical properties of the cells and of specific subcellular components. Secondly, that stem cells are able to detect and respond to alterations in the stiffness of their surrounding microenvironment via induction of lineage-specific differentiation. Finally, the application of external mechanical forces to stem cells, transduced through a variety of mechanisms, can initiate and drive differentiation processes. The coalescence of these three key concepts permit the introduction of a new theory for the maintenance of stem cells and alternatively their differentiation via the concept of a stem cell 'mechano-niche', defined as a specific combination of cell mechanical properties, extracellular matrix stiffness and external mechanical cues conducive to the maintenance of the stem cell population. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Lineage specification is strongly sensitive to the mechanical properties of the cellular environment. However, molecular pathways transducing matrix mechanical cues to intracellular signaling pathways linked to lineage specification remain unclear. We found that the mechanically gated ion channel Piezo1 is expressed by brainderived human neural stem/progenitor cells and is responsible for a mechanically induced ionic current. Piezo1 activity triggered by traction forces elicited influx of Ca2+, a known modulator of differentiation, in a substrate-stiffness-dependent manner. Inhibition of channel activity by the pharmacological inhibitor GsMTx-4 or by siRNA-mediated Piezo1 knockdown suppressed neurogenesis and enhanced astrogenesis. Piezo1 knockdown also reduced the nuclear localization of the mechanoreactive transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein. We propose that the mechanically gated ion channel Piezo1 is an important determinant of mechanosensitive lineage choice in neural stem cells and may play similar roles in other multipotent stem cells.},

Characterizing novel proteins that offer crucial insights into the processes of lung tumour invasion and metastasis may therefore provide much-needed prognostic markers, and influence therapeutic strategies. Aberrant function of the integrin family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors is a common theme in cancer - investigation into novel integrin activity regulators may offer crucial insights into the processes of tumour invasion and metastasis and may reveal insights into potential therapeutic targets. We previously described that depletion of the novel multi-transmembrane domain protein Fam38A, located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inactivates endogenous beta1 integrin affinity, reducing cell adhesion. We now show that depletion of Fam38A, also now known as Piezo1, causes anchorage independence and a switch to a reduced integrin-dependent mode of cell migration/invasion, a novel phenotype for this integrin-regulating protein. Normal lung epithelial cells show increased rates of migration by 2D time-lapse microscopy and increased capacity to invade into matrigel, despite having decreased integrin affinity. We confirm greatly depleted Fam38A expression in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines where a form of reduced integrin-dependent migration, i.e. amoeboid migration, is a known phenotype. We propose that loss of Fam38A expression may cause increased cell migration and metastasis in lung tumours. {\textcopyright} 2012 McHugh et al.},

abstract = {The integrin family of heterodimeric cell-surface receptors are fundamental in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Changes to either integrin-ligand affinity or integrin gene expression are central to a variety of disease processes, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In screening for novel activators of integrin-ligand affinity we identified the previously uncharacterised multi-transmembrane domain protein Fam38A, located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). siRNA knockdown of Fam38A in epithelial cells inactivates endogenous $\beta$1 integrin, reducing cell adhesion. Fam38A mediates integrin activation by recruiting the small GTPase R-Ras to the ER, which activates the calcium-activated protease calpain by increasing Ca2+ release from cytoplasmic stores. Fam38A-induced integrin activation is blocked by inhibition of either R-Ras or calpain activity, or by siRNA knockdown of talin, a well-described calpain substrate. This highlights a novel mechanism for integrin activation by Fam38A, utilising calpain and R-Ras signalling from the ER. These data represent the first description of a novel spatial regulator of R-Ras, of an alternative integrin activation-suppression pathway based on direct relocalisation of R-Ras to the ER, and of a mechanism linking R-Ras and calpain signalling from the ER with modulation of integrin-ligand affinity.},

Furthermore, Piezo1-deficient mice are resistant to further bone loss and bone resorption induced by hind limb unloading, demonstrating that PIEZO1 can affect osteoblast-osteoclast crosstalk in response to mechanical forces. At the mechanistic level, in response to mechanical loads, PIEZO1 in osteoblastic cells controls the YAP-dependent expression of type II and IX collagens. In turn, these collagen isoforms regulate osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data identify PIEZO1 as the major skeletal mechanosensor that tunes bone homeostasis.},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION Does the shear stress sensing ion channel subunit Piezo1 have an important mechanotransduction role in human fetoplacental endothelium? SUMMARY ANSWER Piezo1 is present and functionally active in human fetoplacental endothelial cells, and disruption of Piezo1 prevents the normal response to shear stress. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Shear stress is an important stimulus for maturation and function of placental vasculature but the molecular mechanisms by which the force is detected and transduced are unclear. Piezo1 channels are Ca 2+ -permeable non-selective cationic channels which are critical for shear stress sensing and maturation of murine embryonic vasculature. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS We investigated the relevance of Piezo1 to placental vasculature by studying human fetoplacental endothelial cells (FpECs) from healthy pregnancies. Endothelial cells were isolated from placental cotyledons and cultured, for the study of tube formation and cell alignment to shear stress. In addition, human placental arterial endothelial cells were isolated and studied immediately by patch-clamp electrophysiology. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The synthetic Piezo1 channel agonist Yoda1 caused strong elevation of the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration with a 50{\%} effect occurring at about 5.4 $\mu$M. Knockdown of Piezo1 by RNA interference suppressed the Yoda1 response, consistent with it being mediated by Piezo1 channels. Alignment of cells to the direction of shear stress was also suppressed by Piezo1 knockdown without loss of cell viability. Patch-clamp recordings from freshly isolated endothelium showed shear stress-activated single channels which were characteristic of Piezo1. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The in vitro nature of fetoplacental endothelial cell isolation and subsequent culture may affect FpEC characteristics and PIEZO1 expression. In addition to Piezo1, alternative shear stress sensing mechanisms have been suggested in other systems and might also contribute in the placenta. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS These data suggest that Piezo1 is an important molecular determinant of blood flow sensitivity in the placenta. Establishing and manipulating the molecular mechanisms regulating shear stress sensing could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to improve blood flow in the placenta.

abstract = {Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis is a genetic condition with defective red blood cell membrane properties that causes an imbalance in intracellular cation concentrations. Recently, two missense mutations in the mechanically activated PIEZO1 (FAM38A) ion channel were associated with dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. However, it is not known how these mutations affect PIEZO1 function. Here, by combining linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing in a large pedigree and Sanger sequencing in two additional kindreds and 11 unrelated dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis cases, we identify three novel missense mutations and one recurrent duplication in PIEZO1, demonstrating that it is the major gene for dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis. All the dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis-associated mutations locate at C-terminal half of PIEZO1. Remarkably, we find that all PIEZO1 mutations give rise to mechanically activated currents that inactivate more slowly than wild-type currents. This gain-of-function PIEZO1 phenotype provides insight that helps to explain the increased permeability of cations in red blood cells of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis patients.

abstract = {Piezo proteins are transmembrane ion channels which transduce many forms of mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals. Their pore, formed by the assembly of three identical subunits, opens by an unknown mechanism. Here, to probe this mechanism, we investigate the interaction of Piezo1 with the small molecule agonist Yoda1. By engineering chimeras between mouse Piezo1 and its Yoda1-insensitive paralog Piezo2, we first identify a minimal protein region required for Yoda1 sensitivity. We next study the effect of Yoda1 on heterotrimeric Piezo1 channels harboring wild type subunits and Yoda1-insensitive mutant subunits. Using calcium imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology, we show that hybrid channels harboring as few as one Yoda1-sensitive subunit exhibit Yoda1 sensitivity undistinguishable from homotrimeric wild type channels. Our results show that the Piezo1 pore remains fully open if only one subunit remains activated. This study sheds light on the gating and pharmacological mechanisms of a member of the Piezo channel family.},

abstract = {The mesenchymal stroma harbors an important population of cells that possess stem cell-like characteristics including self renewal and differentiation capacities and can be derived from a variety of different sources. These multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be found in nearly all tissues and are mostly located in perivascular niches. MSC have migratory abilities and can secrete protective factors and act as a primary matrix for tissue regeneration during inflammation, tissue injuries and certain cancers. These functions underlie the important physiological roles of MSC and underscore a significant potential for the clinical use of distinct populations from the various tissues. MSC derived from different adult (adipose tissue, peripheral blood, bone marrow) and neonatal tissues (particular parts of the placenta and umbilical cord) are therefore compared in this mini-review with respect to their cell biological properties, surface marker expression and proliferative capacities. In addition, several MSC functions including in vitro and in vivo differentiation capacities within a variety of lineages and immune-modulatory properties are highlighted. Differences in the extracellular milieu such as the presence of interacting neighbouring cell populations, exposure to proteases or a hypoxic microenvironment contribute to functional developments within MSC populations originating from different tissues, and intracellular conditions such as the expression levels of certain micro RNAs can additionally balance MSC function and fate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hass et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.},

However, the effects of hydrostatic pressure (HP) on cell fate determination of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are not clearly understood. Here, we established a cell culture chamber to control HP. Using this system, we found that the promotion of osteogenic differentiation by HP is depend on bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression regulated by Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (PIEZO1) in MSCs. The PIEZO1 was expressed and induced after HP loading in primary MSCs and MSC lines, UE7T-13 and SDP11. HP and Yoda1, an activator of PIEZO1, promoted BMP2 expression and osteoblast differentiation, whereas inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, PIEZO1 inhibition reduced osteoblast differentiation and BMP2 expression. Furthermore, Blocking of BMP2 function by noggin inhibits HP induced osteogenic maker genes expression. In addition, in an in vivo model of medaka with HP loading, HP promoted caudal fin ray development whereas inhibition of piezo1 using GsMTx4 suppressed its development. Thus, our results suggested that PIEZO1 is responsible for HP and could functions as a factor for cell fate determination of MSCs by regulating BMP2 expression.},

Our simulations further indicate that the presence of the agonist correlates with increased tension-induced motions of the Yoda1-bound subunit. Our results suggest a model wherein Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, facilitating force-induced conformational changes, effectively lowering the channel's mechanical threshold for activation. The identification of an allosteric agonist binding site in Piezo1 channels will pave the way for the rational design of future Piezo modulators with clinical value.},

Most cases of hereditary xerocytosis are associated with gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1, a mechanically activated ion channel. We engineered a mouse model of hereditary xerocytosis and show that Plasmodium infection fails to cause experimental cerebral malaria in these mice due to the action of Piezo1 in RBCs and in T cells. Remarkably, we identified a novel human gain-of-function PIEZO1 allele, E756del, present in a third of the African population.

Genetic ablation of both Piezo1 and Piezo2 in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced baroreflex and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack Piezos had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with baroreflex failure.

abstract = {Piezo1 is a eukaryotic cation-selective mechanosensitive ion channel. To understand channel function in vivo, we first need to analyze and compare the response in the whole cell and the patch. In patches, Piezo1 inactivates and the current is fit well by a 3-state model with a single pressure-dependent rate. However, repeated stimulation led to an irreversible loss of inactivation. Remarkably, the loss of inactivation did not occur on a channel-by-channel basis but on all channels at the same time. Thus, the channels are in common mechanical domain. Divalent ions decreased the unitary conductance from ∼68 pS to ∼37 pS, irrespective of the cation species. Mg and Ca did not affect inactivation rates, but Zn caused a 3-fold slowing. CytochalasinD (cytoD) does not alter inactivation rates or the transition to the non-inactivating mode but does reduce the steady-state response. Whole-cell currents were similar to patch currents but also had significant differences. In contrast to the patch, cytoD inhibited the current suggesting that the activating forces were transmitted through the actin cytoskeleton. Hypotonic swelling that prestressed the cytoskeleton and the bilayer greatly increased the sensitivity of both control and cytoD cells so there are two pathways to transmit force to the channels. In contrast to patch, removing divalent ions decreased the whole-cell current. The difference between whole cell and patch properties provide new insights into our understanding of the Piezo1 gating mechanisms and cautions against generalization to in situ behavior. {\textcopyright} 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

Ion channels that sense mechanical force are postulated to play critical roles in a variety of biological processes including sensing touch/pain (somatosensation), sound (hearing), and shear stress (cardiovascular physiology); however, the identity of these ion channels has remained elusive. We previously identified Piezo1 and Piezo2 as mechanically activated cation channels that are expressed in many mechanosensitive cell types. Here, we show that Piezo1 is expressed in endothelial cells of developing blood vessels in mice. Piezo1-deficient embryos die at midgestation with defects in vascular remodeling, a process critically influenced by blood flow. We demonstrate that Piezo1 is activated by shear stress, the major type of mechanical force experienced by endothelial cells in response to blood flow. Furthermore, loss of Piezo1 in endothelial cells leads to deficits in stress fiber and cellular orientation in response to shear stress, linking Piezo1 mechanotransduction to regulation of cell morphology.
