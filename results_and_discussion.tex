\section{Piezo1 as integrator of biomechanical events in MSCs}
\label{sec:piezo1-as-integrator-of-biomechanical-events-in-mscs}

It is well known, that stem cell migration, differentiation and self-renewal is significantly influenced by physical interaction between the cell, its surrounding microenvironment and exogenous forces. \cite{Eyckmans2011, Lee2011} MSCs are arguably the most thoroughly studied type of stem cell in this context, possibly because of the promising potential they hold for regenerative medicine and relative ease of access. Extensive studies of different force parameters (e.g. type, amplitude, static/dynamic) on MSCs give great insight into downstream pathways involved that guide the cells behaviour. However, the significance of \Piezo{} and the associated calcium-ion influx in MSC mechanosensing is not fully understood. In the following part we want to elucidate whether \Piezo{} is functionally able to elicit a significant intracellular signal in MSCs that can be classified as mechanotransductory significant.\\
In a reductionist approach, we conclude a relevant contribution of \Piezo{} if we are able to show that MSCs exhibit a \Piezo{}-mediated influx of extracellular calcium ions in response to mechanical force.\\

For our first experiment, Flowchambers were prepared with wild-type (WT) cells being seeded and stained as described in \vref{sec:FluidicModel}. For each flowchamber two separate calcium imaging recordings were carried out in close temporal sequence to each other: The first recording was done using modified, calcium-free ACSF as flow shear medium. Upon completion of the first recording, the flow shear medium is exchanged for normal, calcium containing ACSF and the cells continuously flushed for 12 minutes with a total volume of 2.4 ml. After the flushing period, a second recording was done with the previously used flow rate protocol but this time with normal ACSF. After both measurements were completed, the integrity of the flowchamber was assessed by eye and the recordings deemed qualified for analysis, when no violation of structural integrity was observed. The sequence of first calcium-free and second calcium-containing medium is important, as reactive capability of the cells has to be demonstrated in the last measurement to rule out cell death as a possible explanation for lack of impulse response. We then concatenated the two measurements and analyzed them. We saw a maximum increase of up to 80\% in fluorescence signal in direct response to shear pulse as opposed to no or slightly negative pulse response in the calcium-free measurement (see \ref{fig:CalcImaging_Cells}). While the amplitude is likely a function of intracellular state, laminar flow defects and flowchamber and grating specific random errors, thus varying over different biological donors, we still see a clear-cut necessity of extracellular calcium-ion presence for successful impulse response. Surprisingly, the shear flow pulse seems to have a negative effect on fluorescence levels of the cell, as illustrated by a bump. We argue that this is likely a technical issue resulting from a combination of loosely-adherent highly fluorescent particles segmented as a cell and the static nature of our segmentation method. During the flow pulse, the particles are swept away, leaving only non-fluorescent substrate and thus leading to an incorrect classification of a decrease in fluorescence. A second technical issue is the apparent discontinuity in fluorescence between the two measurement, with the second measurement starting shy above a ratio of one. We argue this is due to the calcium-starved cell replenishing their intracellular calcium-storages after regaining extracellular supply. As this bias corresponds to maximally 10\% of the fluorescence response, we did not correct for this error. Another minor technicality is the slightly negative slope of the baseline. This corresponds to the known property of fluorescent markers to decrease in fluorescence as a function of light exposure, and is called Photobleaching. As the effect is likely negligible, it is still important to keep in mind, that the signal in the second measurement likely would be slightly higher, since it has the added effect from the first measurement's photobleaching.

\end{figure}

We demonstrated that MSCs exhibit reactive mechanosensitive capabilities through force-mediated rapid onset influx of extracellular calcium-ions. The role of \Piezo{} in this process, however, is not defined. To shed light on the contribution size of \Piezo{} we compared the impulse response capabilities of two distinct \Piezo{}-knock out constructs to a control cell line.\\
In preparation for this experiment three transfected cell lines were generated (2 distinct \Piezo{} knock-out's and one negative control) using pre-made lentivirus, carrying a CRISPR/Cas9-system with puromycin resistance as the selection marker. The grouping is specified through the Lentiviral Construct used, resulting in cell line P1-395 (meaning the guide-RNA targets the 395\textsuperscript{th} base of the \Piezo{}-gene), P1-555 and NoT (No Target, Control for the viral treatment with no putative genome mutation).  In order to assess knock-out efficiency, both Western Blot and qRT-PCR were done after which we were able to consider this cell line a valid knock-out model (see Fig. \ref{fig:KO-Verification}).\\
We then seeded cells in flowchambers and measured the intracellular calcium signal of the cells in response to a shear pulse, similar to the protocol from the previous experiment but only with a single measurement per flowchamber with normal ACSF as shear flow medium. Intriguingly, the knock-out cells show a significantly reduced reaction capability when compared to control (see Fig. \ref{fig:CalcImaging_Cells}). When comparing the relative amount of knock-out cells that exhibit calcium-influx in response to shear stress, we see a 66\% decrease compared to control, with the effect being bigger in P1-395 (-73\%) as in P1-555 (-60\%). Interestingly, this difference between two different constructs regarding their reduction of impulse response correlates with the knock-out efficiency. On the lower left plot, we see the same data as in the lower right, but over full temporal resolution and it illustrates how the area under the curve is largely reduced when \Piezo{} is knocked out. 
These results confirm that \Piezo{} is the main driver in force-mediated calcium-influx in mesenchymal stem cells.

\label{sec:PiezoandECM}

\end{figure}


Preliminary mass spectroscopy secretome analysis of \Yoda-treated cells showed a distinct decrease in core extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as alpha-1 type I collagen (\colone), Fibronectin-1 (\textsc{Fn1}) and finally alpha-1 type III collagen (\colthree) (Not shown here). This inspired further investigation into this matter.\par



After seeding cells in serum-free medium and letting them rest, we chemically stimulated \Piezo{} with \Yoda{} during 30 minutes, before washing them and transferring them in the incubator again, following the protocol described earlier ~\vref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}. We then harvested identical samples right after intervention (denoted by d0) and after 24, 48 and 72 hours (d1, d2 and d3, respectively) to achieve temporal resolution. There were minor loading problems during Western Blotting, but we concluded the blots to be valid as they did not significantly affect the central tendency of our data. \par

(n=3, Two-sided student's t-test)
	}
	\label{pic:UliBlot}
\end{figure}

Western Blot Analysis of intracellular protein showed a trend of declining \colone-content in samples that have been treated with \Yoda{} (As shown in \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_WB}). Furthermore, the effects were not only marked by fast onset but also of long-lasting nature, since the effect of a singular 30 minutes \Yoda{}-exposition remained the same three days after intervention. Similar effects can also be seen in \textsc{Fn1} and \colthree{} (see ~\vref{pic:UliBlot}.) \par

Using qRT-PCR, we also looked at mRNA representation while biasing our investigation towards \colone{}, \colthree{}, \textsc{Fn}1 and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) with GAPDH and RPL13A as house-keeping genes. All measurements were normalised against negative control samples harvested immediately after the intervention. \\
IL-6 results are inconclusive because of the big variance. However, there is a trend of a sharp increase in \Yoda{} samples from d0 to d1 followed by a relaxation over following three days to near-normal levels. This strong response is interesting, but it remains to be investigated, whether this translates to a \textit{de facto} increase in bioactive IL-6 protein. mRNA levels of \colone{} show a decreasing trend over time, while \colthree and \textsc{Fn}1 stayed largely the same (see Fig. \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_PCR})\\\par

Interestingly, the trend of \colone{}, \colthree{} and \textsc{Fn1} being largely reduced on protein level is not reflected by the mRNA representation. Since mRNA levels are unchanged and secretome analysis reflects the decrease, the effect of the intervention must act between transcription of mRNA and secretion of the protein. \\
ECM components are known to be post-transcriptionally modified both in the ER and in the endosomal compartments, which are the transporter entities involved in the secretion \cite{Ishida2011, Zeltz2014}, which makes additional studies necessary for more sophisticated hypothesis. One straightforward explanation for the observation could be calpain, a protease that relies on calcium as a cofactor for effector function \cite{Goll2003}. McHugh and colleagues produced evidence for calpain being a downstream effector of \Piezo{} \cite{McHugh2010}. Furthermore, there are studies that link calpain activity to skin wound healing, which is heavily dependent on ECM and specifically \colone{} \cite{Nassar2012}. However, in this paper, Nassar and colleagues demonstrate that calpain-inhibition leads to reduction of \colone{} mRNA, which implicitly contradicts this data. To further investigate this dynamic, it might be worthwhile to investigate the relationship between \Piezo{}-dependent calcium influx and subsequent activation of calpain. \par

One important thing to keep in mind is the design of this study. Cells were previously cultured with 5 \textmu{}g/ml FGF-2 and 10\% FBS, before they were serum-starved and FGF-2 deprived for the experiment. This likely leads to confounding factor including differentiation, which would have to be addressed in future studies.\par

In conclusion, this divergence between decreased protein with largely normal mRNA levels as a consequence of \Piezo{}-stimulation introduces a new dimension, inspiring further research into the topic.

\section{Reversibility and osteogenic differentiation}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:LongTerm_PCR}
\end{figure}

As we saw that intracellular \colone{} protein levels did not recover during our previously chosen time frame, we wanted to investigate whether the \Yoda{}-treated cells would reach a pre-intervention homeostatic state after a longer duration. For this reason, we decided to repeat the experiment from before, but only harvesting the cells after seven days (168 hours). Because in the experiment before we qualitatively saw a steady decrease in cell viability, as assessed by morphological changes in \Yoda{}-treated samples (see on page \pageref{pic:Yoda_Apop}), we adapted the protocol to improve cell viability. In order to allow for sufficient cell survival until harvesting, the medium was changed three days after the intervention. Half of the cells received serum-free MEM\textalpha{} (Group denoted by S-), whereas the other half was administered MEM\textalpha{} with 10\% FBS (denoted by S+). For this experiment we only did qRT-PCR, since we were technically limited due to very low yield in the S-/Y+ - group. All samples were pooled triplicates and normalized against negative control samples from day 7.\\
Interestingly, in our experiment the RNA levels of \colone{} was still drastically lowered independent from FBS supplementation, with as low as 12\% in the serum-starved group. While \colthree{} was also low, this could also be explained by a great variance, which we saw in the experiment before (see Fig. \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_PCR}). IL-6 and \textsc{Fn}1 was slightly reduced. It is important to keep in mind, due to the experiment being a single measurement, this qualifies only as an exploratory experiment at best.\\
However, there are some plausible indications. For example, it is interesting to note, that IL-6 recovered completely to pre-intervention level, as implied in the experiment before. \\
Furthermore, when looking at \colone{} in serum-suplemented samples, while the PCR levels remained low (~ 30\% of negative control), the cells proliferated and seemed "happy". This implies that \Piezo{}-mediated apoptosis and downregulation of ECM components are mediated by two independent pathways, both downstream of \Piezo{}, as the apoptosis-effect discussed in the next chapter is neutralized by addition of FBS, whereas the downregulation of \colone{} seemingly is not.\\
One alternative explanation would be that the applied \Yoda{}-stimulus leads to a persistent change and possibly to differentiation.\par

Sugimoto and colleagues suggested that \Piezo{} activation leads to osteogenic (meaning bone-like) differentiation \cite{Sugimoto2017}. To test whether we reproduced their results by \Piezo{}-activation, we employed the same protocol, consisting of 30min 5\textmu{}M \Yoda{} intervention with the only experimental sample from day 3, which then are normalized against negative control samples harvested right after the intervention. As read-out method we chose qRT-PCR, following Sugimoto's paper, and biased our analysis against both early osteogenic genes like RUNX2 and late osteogenic genes like ALPL and SPP1 \cite{Marom2005, Creecy2013}. \par

	\label{fig:Osteo_PCR}
\end{figure}
 

The tendency of our results showed no significant result. However, this does not mean, that we can exclude \Piezo{} implicated in osteogenic differentiation. One central aspect of Sugimoto's study was the existence of a certain "sweetspot" of hydrostatic pressure where osteogenic differentiation happens, after which increasing pressure would lead to insignificant results. It is plausible that the quality our \Piezo{} stimulus would need adaptation for succesful reproduction of Sugimoto's results.



\section{Excursion: Biostability of \Yoda{} and \Piezo{} mediated apoptosis}
\label{sec:biostability}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{Yoda_Apoptosis.png}
	\caption{Light microscopy picture of serum-starved cells 7 days after intervention with either 0\textmu{}M (negative Control) or 5\textmu{}M (Yoda) chemical \Piezo{}-agonist.}
	\label{pic:Yoda_Apop}
\end{figure}

We realised there was a continuous and large decrease in cell count in \Yoda{}-treated cells (see \ref{pic:Yoda_Apop}). Next to \Piezo{} being implicated in this pro-apoptotic effect, an intrinsic cytotoxicity of \Yoda{} could also be an explanation. To test this hypothesis, Uli, in an explorative experiment, exposed both \Piezo{}-KO and NoT Cell Lines to \Yoda{} similar to the one described ~\vref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}, where it became clear that apoptosis was \Piezo{} dependent. (not shown) While there were no further investigations done, this observed behaviour could be explained with calpain activation, downstream of \Piezo{}, that has known pro-apoptotic effects through caspase-3 and caspase-12 activation \cite{Nakagawa2000, Altznauer2004}. Furthermore, there is evidence that relates different intracellular calcium concentration to a set of cellular mechanisms, including cell migration and apoptosis. Here it might be worthwhile, to alter experimental \Yoda{} concentration to explore different regions of the continuous cellular process spectrum. Another thing to keep in mind is that \Yoda{} activity might not only vary with concentration but also with time.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.4\linewidth{}]{Inkubationshypothese.png}
	\caption{Identical cells depending either exposed to \Yoda{}, which has been pre-incubated for 8hours, for 0h or no Yoda at all.}
	\label{fig:Inkubationshypothese_Western}
\end{figure}

Our observations suggested that in standard incubation conditions \Yoda{} is transformed and looses its effect over time. (not shown). To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment similar to the one described in \ref{sec:ChemicalStimulation} only modifying the intervention medium between the three groups. Each group's media was pre-incubated for 8 hours before intervention and either supplemented with 5\textmu{}M \Yoda{} before pre-incubation (8 hours Incubation) or supplemented with 5\textmu{}M \Yoda{} directly after pre-incubation (No Incubation) or no \Yoda{} at all (Control). We found that incubation of \Yoda{} during a certain amount of time diminishes its bioactivity completely. This has not been published knowledge, but should be considered in future study designs.
