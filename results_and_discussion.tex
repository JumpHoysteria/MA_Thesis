\section{\Piezo{} as integrator of mechanical shear forces in MSCs}
\label{sec:piezo1-as-integrator-of-biomecshanical-events-in-mscs}

It is well known, that stem cell migration, differentiation and self-renewal is significantly influenced by physical interaction between the cell, its surrounding microenvironment and exogenous forces. \cite{Eyckmans2011, Lee2011} MSCs are arguably the most thoroughly studied type of stem cell in this context, possibly because of the promising potential they hold for regenerative medicine and relative ease of access. Extensive studies of different force parameters (e.g. type, amplitude, static/dynamic) on MSCs give great insight into downstream pathways involved that guide the cells behaviour. However, the significance of \Piezo{} and the associated calcium-ion influx in MSC mechanosensing is not fully understood. In the following part we want to elucidate whether \Piezo{} is functionally able to elicit a significant intracellular signal in MSCs that can be classified as mechanotransductory significant.\\
In a reductionist approach, we conclude a relevant contribution of \Piezo{} if we are able to show that MSCs exhibit a \Piezo{}-mediated influx of extracellular calcium ions in response to mechanical force.\\

For our first experiment, flow chambers were prepared with cells being seeded and stained as described in chapter~\vref{sec:FluidicModel}. For each flow chamber two separate calcium imaging recordings were carried out in close temporal sequence to each other: The first recording was done using calcium-free medium. Upon completion of the first recording, the flow shear medium is exchanged for normal, calcium containing medium and the cells continuously flushed for 12 minutes with a total volume of 2.4 ml. After the flushing period, a second recording was done with the previously used flow rate protocol but this time with calcium containing medium. The sequence of first calcium-free and second calcium-containing medium is important, as reactive capability of the cells has to be demonstrated in the last measurement to rule out cell death as a possible explanation for lack of impulse response. Analysis showed a maximum increase of up to 80\% in fluorescence signal in direct response to shear pulse as opposed to largely absent pulse response in the calcium-free measurement (see Figure \ref{fig:CalcImaging_Cells}a). While the amplitude is likely a function of intracellular state, we oberseve a clear-cut necessity of extracellular calcium-ion presence for intracellular calcium responses. Surprisingly, the shear flow pulse seems to have a negative effect on fluorescence levels of the cell, as illustrated by a bump. We argue that this is likely a technical issue resulting from a combination of loosely-adherent highly fluorescent particles segmented as a cell and the static nature of our segmentation method. During the flow pulse, the particles are swept away, leaving only non-fluorescent substrate and thus leading to an incorrect classification of a decrease in fluorescence. A second technical issue is the apparent discontinuity in fluorescence between the two measurement, with the second measurement starting shy above a ratio of one. We argue this is due to the calcium-starved cell replenishing their intracellular calcium-storages after regaining extracellular supply. The slightly negative slope of the baseline is probably due to photobleaching

\end{figure}

We demonstrated that MSCs exhibit reactive mechanosensitive capabilities through force-mediated rapid onset influx of extracellular calcium-ions. The role of \Piezo{} in this process, however, is not defined. To examine the contribution of \Piezo{} we compared the impulse response capabilities of two distinct \Piezo{}-knock out constructs to a control cell line.\\
In preparation for this experiment three transfected cell lines were generated (2 distinct \Piezo{} knock-out's and one negative control) using pre-made lentivirus, carrying a CRISPR/Cas9-system with puromycin resistance as the selection marker. The grouping is specified through the Lentiviral Construct used, resulting in cell line P1-395 (meaning the guide-RNA targets the 395\textsuperscript{th} base of \PiezoGene{}), P1-555 and NoT (No Target, Control for the viral treatment with no putative genome mutation). In order to assess knock-out efficiency, both Western Blot and qRT-PCR were done after which we were able to consider this cell line a valid knock-out model (see Fig. \ref{fig:KO-Verification}).\\

NoT describes control for viral treatment with no putative mutation in genome. n = 1, for mRNA and Protein.}
	\label{fig:KO-Verification}
\end{figure}

We then seeded cells in flow chambers and measured the intracellular calcium signal of the cells in response to a shear pulse, similar to the protocol from the previous experiment but only with a single measurement per flow chamber with normal ACSF as shear flow medium. Intriguingly, the \PiezoGene{} knock-out cells show a significantly reduced reaction capability when compared to control (see Figure \ref{fig:CalcImaging_Cells}c,d). When comparing the relative amount of knock-out cells that exhibit calcium-influx in response to shear stress, we see a 66\% decrease compared to control, with the effect being bigger in P1-395 (-73\%) as in P1-555 (-60\%). Interestingly, this difference between two different constructs regarding their reduction of impulse response correlates with the knock-out efficiency. On the lower left plot, we see the same data as in the lower right, but over full temporal resolution and it illustrates how the area under the curve is largely reduced when \Piezo{} is knocked out. 
These results confirm that \Piezo{} is the main driver in force-mediated calcium-influx in mesenchymal stem cells.

\section{\Piezo{} and extracellular matrix production}
\label{sec:PiezoandECM}

Preliminary mass spectroscopy secretome analysis of \Yoda-treated stromal cells showed a distinct decrease in core extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as alpha-1 type I collagen (\colone), Fibronectin-1 (FN1) and alpha-1 type III collagen (\colthree) (Not shown here, personal communication with Fabian Passini and Ulrich Blache). This led to further investigation into this matter.\par


After seeding cells in serum-free medium and letting them rest, we chemically stimulated \Piezo{} with \Yoda{} during 30 minutes, before washing them and transferring them in the incubator again, following the protocol described earlier in section ~\vref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}. We then harvested control samples right after intervention (denoted by d0) and \Yoda{}- and control samples after 24, 48 and 72 hours (d1, d2 and d3, respectively) to achieve temporal resolution. \par

	\label{pic:UliBlot}
\end{figure}

Western Blot Analysis of intracellular protein showed a trend of declining \colone-content in samples that have been treated with \Yoda{} (As shown in \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_WB}). Furthermore, the effects were not only marked by fast onset but also of long-lasting nature, since the effect of a singular 30 minutes \Yoda{}-exposition remained the same three days after intervention. There were inconsistencies in our housekeeping protein bands, indicating possible loading problems. Similar effects can also be seen in \textsc{Fn1} and \colthree{} (see Figure~\vref{pic:UliBlot}.) \par

Using qRT-PCR, we also looked at mRNA representation while focusing on \coloneGene{}, \colthreeGene{}, \Fn{} and \textit{Interleukin-6} (\IL{}) with \textit{GAPDH} and \textit{RPL13A} as house-keeping genes. All measurements were normalised against negative control samples harvested immediately after the intervention. \\
\ILGene results are not significant, due to high variance. However, there is a trend of a sharp increase in \Yoda{} samples from d0 to d1 followed by a relaxation over following three days to original levels. This tendency is interesting, but it remains to be investigated, whether it translates to a \textit{de facto} increase in bioactive \IL protein. mRNA levels of \colone{} show a decreasing trend over time, while \colthree and \textsc{Fn}1 stayed largely the same (see Fig. \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_PCR})\par

\section{Reversibility and osteogenic differentiation of \Yoda{}-treated cells}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth{}]{LongTerm_CellPicture.png}
	\caption{

	\label{fig:LongTerm_PCR}
\end{figure}

Because we found that intracellular \colone{} protein levels did not recover during our previously chosen time frame, we wanted to investigate whether the \Yoda{}-treated cells would reach a pre-intervention state after a longer duration. For this reason, we decided to repeat the experiment from before, but only harvesting the cells after seven days. Because in the experiment before we saw a change in cell morphology in \Yoda{}-treated samples, which indicates a decrease in cell viability (see Fig. \ref{pic:Yoda_Apop}), we adapted the protocol to ensure cell viability. The medium was changed three days after the intervention, where one group of cells received serum-free MEM\textalpha{} (S-), whereas the other half was administered MEM\textalpha{} with 10\% FBS (S+). For this experiment we only did qRT-PCR, due to very low yield in the serum-starved \Yoda{}-group (S-\textbackslash{}Y+)). All samples were pooled triplicates and normalized against negative \Yoda{}-control samples from day 7.\\
Interestingly, in our experiment the RNA levels of \colone{} was still drastically lowered independent from FBS supplementation, with as low as 12\% in the serum-starved group. While \colthreeGene{} was also low, this could also be explained by a great variance, which we saw in the experiment before (see Fig. \ref{fig:Yoda_Norm_PCR}). \ILGene and \FnGene was slightly reduced. It is important to keep in mind, due to the experiment being a single measurement, this qualifies only as an exploratory experiment at best.\\
However, there are some plausible indications. For example, it is interesting to note, that IL-6 seemed to recover completely to pre-intervention level, as implied in the experiment before. \\
Furthermore, when looking at \coloneGene{} in serum-supplemented \Yoda{}-samples, while the PCR levels remained low (see Fig.~\ref{fig:LongTerm_PCR}), the cells proliferated and exhibited a spindle-like morphology, as opposed to sparse density and rounded morphology obeserved in serum-starved \Yoda{}-samples (see Fig.~\ref{pic:Cells_LongTerm} ). This implies that \Piezo{}-mediated downregulation of components and decrease of cell viability are mediated by two independent pathways, both downstream of \Piezo{}, as the decrease in cell viability discussed in the next chapter seems neutralized by addition of FBS, whereas the downregulation of \coloneGene{} seemingly is not.\\
One alternative explanation would be that the applied \Yoda{}-stimulus leads to a persistent change and possibly to differentiation.\par

Sugimoto and colleagues suggested that \Piezo{} activation leads to osteogenic differentiation \cite{Sugimoto2017}. To test whether we reproduced their results by \Piezo{}-activation, we employed the same protocol, consisting of 30min 5\textmu{}M \Yoda{} intervention with the only experimental sample from day 3, which then are normalized against negative control samples harvested right after the intervention. As read-out method we chose qRT-PCR, following Sugimoto's paper, and biased our analysis against both early osteogenic genes like RUNX2 and late osteogenic genes like ALPL and SPP1 \cite{Marom2005, Creecy2013}. \par

	\label{fig:Osteo_PCR}
\end{figure}
 

Our results showed no significant differences. However, this does not mean, that we can exclude \Piezo{} implicated in osteogenic differentiation. One central aspect of Sugimoto's study was the existence of a certain "sweetspot" of hydrostatic pressure where osteogenic differentiation happens, after which increasing pressure would lead to insignificant results. It is plausible that the quality our \Piezo{} stimulus would need adaptation for successful reproduction of Sugimoto's results.



\section{Excursion: Biostability of \Yoda{} and \Piezo{} mediated apoptosis}
\label{sec:biostability}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{Yoda_Apoptosis.png}
	\caption{Light microscopy picture of serum-starved cells 7 days after intervention with 0\textmu{}M (negative Control) or 5\textmu{}M (Yoda) chemical \Piezo{}-agonist.}
	\label{pic:Yoda_Apop}
\end{figure}

We realised there was a continuous decrease in cell count in \Yoda{}-treated cells (see Fig.~\ref{pic:Yoda_Apop}). Next to \Piezo{} being implicated in this decrease in cell viability, an intrinsic cytotoxicity of \Yoda{} could also be an explanation. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Ulrich Blache exposed, in an explorative experiment, both \Piezo{}-KO and NoT cell lines to \Yoda{}, using a protocol similar to the one described in chapter ~\vref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}. The results of this experiment suggestested that the effect was \Piezo{} dependent (not shown). Further experiments are needed to make any conclusions. However, this observation could be explained with calpain activation, downstream of \Piezo{}, that has known pro-apoptotic effects through caspase-3 and caspase-12 activation \cite{Nakagawa2000, Altznauer2004}. Furthermore, there is evidence that relates different intracellular calcium concentration to a set of cellular mechanisms, including apoptosis. Here it might be worthwhile, to alter experimental \Yoda{} concentration to explore different regions of the continuous cellular process spectrum. Another thing to keep in mind is that \Yoda{} activity might not only vary with concentration but also with time.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width = 0.4\linewidth{}]{Inkubationshypothese.png}
	\caption{Western Blot of intracellular protein of MSCs one day after undergoing a modified protocol described in chapter~\ref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}. We altered both the amount of \Yoda{} in intervention medium and duration of \Yoda{} pre-incubation before being added to the cells. For all groups, the respective intervention medium was incubated for 8 hours at standard incubation conditions. One intervention medium was incubated with 5 \mul{}M \Yoda{} (8h Yoda Invervention), another intervention medium was supplemented with 5 \mul{}M \Yoda{} only after incubation, right before giving it to the cells (No Yoda Intervention) and third group was \Yoda{} control (Control).}
	\label{fig:Inkubationshypothese_Western}
\end{figure}

Our observations suggested that in standard incubation conditions \Yoda{} is transformed and loses its effect over time (not shown). To test this hypothesis, we employed a modified version of the protocol described in chapter~\ref{sec:ChemicalStimulation}. We altered both the amount of \Yoda{} in the intervention medium and duration of \Yoda{} pre-incubation before being added to the cells. For all groups, we introduced a pre-incubation period of 8 hours, durng which the respective intervention medium was incubated at standard incubation conditions. One intervention medium was incubated containing 5 \mul{}M \Yoda{} (8h Yoda Invervention), another intervention medium was supplemented with 5 \mul{}M \Yoda{} only after pre-incubation, right before giving it to the cells (No Yoda Intervention) and third group was \Yoda{} control (Control). We found that incubation of \Yoda{} during a certain amount of time seems to diminish its bioactivity completely. This has not been published knowledge, but should be considered in future study designs.

\chapter{Discussion}



PROTEIN DISCUSSION:


Interestingly, the trend of \colone{}, \colthree{} and \Fn{} being largely reduced on protein level is not reflected by the mRNA representation. Since mRNA levels are unchanged and secretome analysis reflects the decrease seen in intracellular protein, the effect of the intervention likely acts between transcription of mRNA and secretion of the protein. \\


ECM components are known to be post-transcriptionally modified both in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and in the endosomes, which are the transporter entities involved in the secretion \cite{Ishida2011, Zeltz2014}. This makes additional studies necessary for more sophisticated hypothesis. One possible explanation for the observation could be calpain, a protease that relies on calcium as a cofactor for effector function \cite{Goll2003}. McHugh and colleagues produced evidence for calpain being a downstream effector of \Piezo{} \cite{McHugh2010}. Furthermore, there are studies that link calpain activity to skin wound healing, which is heavily dependent on ECM and specifically \colone{} \cite{Nassar2012}. However, in this paper, Nassar and colleagues demonstrate that calpain-inhibition leads to reduction of \colone{} mRNA, which implicitly contradicts our data. To further investigate this dynamic, it might be worthwhile to investigate the relationship between \Piezo{}-dependent calcium influx and subsequent activation of calpain. \par

Important to note is that cells were previously cultured with 5 \textmu{}g/ml FGF-2 and 10\% FBS, before they were serum-starved and FGF-2 deprived for the experiment. This likely leads to confounding factor including differentiation, which would have to be addressed in future studies.\par

In conclusion, this divergence between decreased protein with largely normal mRNA levels as a consequence of \Piezo{} stimulation introduces a new dimension, inspiring further research into the topic.
