\chapter{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Experiments can be validated by reproducing results from Yoda1 experiment with shear.
    \item Yoda maybe anti-osteogenic differentiation (As Fibronectin heavily implicated in osteoblast differentiation (Moursi, Fibronectin regulates calvarial osteoblast differentiation)).
    \item Long Term: They start to grow again, but collagen1 remains low
    \item Caveat: Yoda1 stimulation could have been to strong! (Even though it is largely taken from literature)
\end{itemize}

McHugh and colleagues report reduced calpain activity in knock-down of Piezo1 [McHugh 2011], calpain being a Ca\textsuperscript{2+} dependent protease. [Goll2003]. If it would be shown that increased Piezo1 activity could also lead to increased Calpain activity (the mirrored case of McHugh's report), then this could be a second explanation.
